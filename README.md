# Pept-hide_And_Seek

A machine learning tool for protein subcelular localization.
We use 3 different methods, tree-based, feed-forward neural-networks and LSSTMs.
Using Keras and scikit-learn.
Input data comes in FASTA form, and the distinction is between 4 locations.
We have achived 76.3% accuracy using the NN.
